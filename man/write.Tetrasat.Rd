\title{
Write Genotype Data in Tetrasat Format
}
\description{
  Given a \code{genambig} object,
  \code{write.Tetrasat} creates a file that can be read by the software
  Tetrasat and Tetra.
}
\usage{
write.Tetrasat(object, samples = Samples(object),
               loci = Loci(object), file = "")
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
A \code{genambig} object containing the dataset of interest.  Genotypes,
population identities, microsatellite repeat lengths, and the dataset
description of \code{object} are used by the function.
}
  \item{samples}{
A character vector of samples to write to the file.  Should be a subset
of \code{Samples(object)}.
}
  \item{loci}{
A character vector of loci to write to the file.  Should be a subset of
\code{Loci(object)}.
}
  \item{file}{
A character string indicating the file to which to write.
}
}
\details{
Tetrasat files are space-delimited text files in which all alleles at a
locus are concatenated into a string eight characters long.  Population
names or numbers are not used in the file, but samples are ordered by
population, with the line \dQuote{Pop} delimiting populations.

\code{write.Tetrasat} divides each allele by the length of the repeat and
rounds down in order to convert alleles to repeat numbers.  If
necessary, it subtracts a multiple of 10 from all alleles at a locus to
make all allele values less than 100, or puts a zero in front of the
number if it only has one digit.  If the individual is fully homozygous
at a locus, the single allele is repeated four times.  If any genotype
has more than four alleles, \code{write.Tetrasat} picks a random sample of
four alleles without replacement, and prints a warning.  Missing data
are represented by blank spaces.

Sample names should be a maximum of 20 characters long in order for the
file to be read correctly by Tetrasat or Tetra.

\value{
A file is written but no value is returned.
