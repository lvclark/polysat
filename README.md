polysat 1.7: tools for polyploid microsatellite analysis

This is an R package for the analysis of microsatellite genotype data in polyploid organisms.  The version here on GitHub
is the development version.  The stable version of polysat is available on
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/polysat/).

To learn more about polysat, see the [wiki](https://github.com/lvclark/polysat/wiki).

## Inclusivity and code of conduct

The ultimate goal of polysat is to enable research that strives to end world hunger and conserve biodiversity.  On that note, I actively welcome input and contributions from diverse and underrepresented sources to help improve the software, and have adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lvclark/polysat/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).  If there is something I can do or add to make polysat more useful and approachable to you, [post an issue](https://github.com/lvclark/polysat/issues) or send me an [email](mailto:lvclark@illinois.edu)!  If you would like to create a new function yourself or propose edits to the code or documentation, feel free to make a pull request!  All levels of experience are welcome and you can contact me if you aren't sure how to get started with GitHub.
